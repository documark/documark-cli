# Documark CLI

Install this globally and you'll have access to the `documark` command anywhere on your system.

```bash
npm install -g documark-cli
```

Note: The job of the `documark` command is to load and run the version of Documark you have installed locally to your project, irrespective of its version. Starting with Documark v0.4, you should never install Documark itself globally. For more information about why, [please read this][global-vs-local].
